Joseph Hamilton from 4&5 period
Data Types
Which of these is an integer?
4
“I like cows”
“Purple”
“gfdsa”
1
Integers are always numbers
Print Function
Which of these is the correct way to use the print function?
print(“Hi”)
print Hi
print = “Hi”
print.printy.hi.printy.happy.icecream
1
Print statements use parenthesis
Data types
Which of these is a boolean?
True
4
235
0
1
Booleans are not numbers
If statements
What do you end if statements with?
A colon
An emoji
blood
Horse intestines
1
If statements need colons to work
Variable Names
What is the best name for a variable to record the number of dead kittens in your basement?
dead_kittens
fashasdgsad
kldsagdsjsadjj
dkdkddkdkgfasjjgjgjgj
1
Variable names should describe what the variable is meant to represent
Assigning variables
How would you set dead_kittens to 5?
dead_kittens = 5
dead_kittens = 6
dead_kittens = 7
dead_kittens = 8
1
In Python, 5 == 5
Operators
How would you add 6 to dead_kittens?
dead_kittens = dead_kittens + 6
dead_kittens = dead_kittens - 6
dead_kittens = dead_kittens % 6
dead_kittens = dead_kittens * 6
1
In Python, + is the symbol used for addition
Lists
How would you make a list called “salad”
salad = []
dskflagads = []
Horses = []
salad = True
1
Lists are made with [] and they need to be named what you are naming them
List functions
How would you add dead_kittens to salad?
salad.append(dead_kittens)
salad.dsaghsasdhsa(dead_kittens)
salad.dsaghjkljjkjkjogjjksasdhsa(dead_kittens)
salad.dsagoijokjfahoafkhjohfkjhofdjhkjfobkjhsasdhsa(dead_kittens)
1
.append adds things to lists
Len function
How would you find the current length of salad?
len(salad)
torture it untill it tells you
measure it with a barometer
bird(salad)
1
len() returns the length of the thing you pass in
List length
What would len(salad) return?
1
2
12
1.8 billion
1
The salad currently has only one item
Stupid question #1
Since the length of the salad is 1, about how long is each of your dead kittens?
0.090909 list measurement units
14 list measurement units
0 lmus(list measurement units)
15 lmus
1
1(the length of the salad) divided by 11(the number of kittens in the salad) = about 0.090909 lmus
String formatting
Which of these would create an ad advertising the length of your kitten salad?
ad = str.format(“My salad is {} lmus long!”, len(salad))
ad = str.format(“My salad is ## lmus long!”, len(salad))
ad = str.format(“My salad is %% lmus long!”, len(salad))
ad = str.format(“My salad is __ lmus long!”, len(salad))
1
Str.format uses {} to specify where variables go
Cacatination
Which of these would attach the string “ Yum!” to the end of ad?
ad = ad + “ Yum!”
ad = ad $ “ Yum!”
ad = ad ( “ Yum!”
ad = ad @ “ Yum!”
1
The + symbol is also used for Cacatination
Endless loops
Which of these would print ad forever?
while True: (pretend there is a new line and a tab here) print(ad)
while True: (pretend there is a new line and a tab here) print(ad) (pretend there is a new line and a tab here) break
while False: (pretend there is a new line and a tab here) print(ad)
while 3 == 4: (pretend there is a new line and a tab here) tprint(ad)
1
Endless loops can never evaluate to false, and can never hit a break statement
Syntax
Which of these will not return a syntax error?
kitten_salad = “delicious”
kitten_salad ==== “gross”
kitten_salad is not  “delicious”
kitten_salad != “delicious”
1
A single = symbol is what you use to assign variables
Logical operators
Which of these would evaluate to true?
“delicious” in kitten_salad or 4 == 3
“delicious” not in kitten_salad
“gross” in kitten_salad and 4 == 3
“gross” in kitten_salad or 4 == 3
1
An or statement returns true if either of the sides is true
Defining functions
How would you define a function called “eat” that takes a parameter called “object”?
def eat(object):
sadfhklfsjh;l
dashhwijrhirrjhjj
jajjjjajjajjajjihihihhihihii
1
The def keyword is used when defining functions
Calling functions
How would you call the eat function on salad?
eat(salad)
eat()salad
saladeat()
easaladt()
1
Parameters for functions are put within the parenthesis
Stupid question #2
What is the correct answer to this question?
1

The correct answer is 1
